# US-Medical-Insurance-Cost-Project



This data set is proposed by Codecademy as the first project for data analysis. I analyzed the data set as thoroughly as possible, trying to implement everything I've learned from, statistics/econometrics and previous Data Science courses. Though, the true source of the data set is unknown, the inferences from the data set may not be grounded in reality.

### What is data set it about?ðŸ¤¨

As you might have guessed by the name of the project itself, the data set contains insurance cost data about 1338 individuals. The main variables of the data set are the person's age, sex(dummy), BMI, number of children, smoker(dummy), and the region where the person is living.

### My train of thoughtðŸ¤“

+ What is the sample size?
+ Any unusual observasions? (Duplicates, missing or inconsistent data)
+ What are types of data? (Object, float, etc.)
+ Distributions of given variables? (i.e distribution of BMI, age, number of children across age, number of smokers...)
+ Relations between variables (i.e correlation between age and BMI, insurance cost conditional on smoking...)
+ Run a regression on insurance costs as the dependent variable.
+ Implement a supervised learning model, predicting the insurance costs for various individuals. Also for those not included in the data set.
